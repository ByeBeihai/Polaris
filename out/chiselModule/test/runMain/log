[[34mdeprecated[0m] class utils.FlushableQueueIO (1 calls): Unable to automatically infer cloneType on class utils.FlushableQueueIO. cloneType is now implemented by the Chisel compiler plugin so please ensure you are using it in your build. If you cannot use the compiler plugin or you are using it and you still see this message, please file an issue and let us know. For those not using the plugin, here is the 'runtime reflection' cloneType error message: constructor has parameters (entries) that are not both immutable and accessible. Either make all parameters immutable and accessible (vals) so cloneType can be inferred, or define a custom cloneType method.
